Unisave is a backend service for games developed in Unity. It attempts
to not only solve common problems like player registration but also
lets you develop custom backend logic in C#, the language you already
use for your Unity project.

This repository contains the [asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/142705),
distributed via the Unity Asset Store. It contains the code that facilitates Unity editor integration.
Your backend code, however, interacts primarily with
the [Unisave Framework](https://github.com/Jirka-Mayer/UnisaveFramework),
bundled within this asset as a `.dll` library.
