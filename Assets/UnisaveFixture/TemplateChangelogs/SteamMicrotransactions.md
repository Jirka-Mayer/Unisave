# Steam microtransactions


## TODOs

- add `public string playerEntityId;` to the transaction entity and
  assign it to `Auth.Id()` during transaction initiation. And during
  transaction finalization check that it remained the same. `null` value
  is ok, authentication is not a prerequisite for microtransactions.
